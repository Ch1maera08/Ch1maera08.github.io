                      <p>
                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls.
                        What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.
                        However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.
                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures,
                        Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                        On the other hand, her classmate, the boring, gloomy Izumi Miyamura tends to get painted as a ""loser fanboy."" But when a liberally pierced and tattooed (not to mention downright gorgeous) 
                        Miyamura appears unexpectedly on the doorstep of secretly plain-Jane homebody Hori, these two similarly dissimilar teenagers discover that there are multiple sides to every story...and person!

                        When it comes to the VRMMO NewWorld Online, Kaede Honjou isn't your run-of-the-mill greenhorn gamer. Forgoing a typical stat allocation for her Great Shielder, 
                        Maple, she pumps all her points into defense from the get-go! Her reasoning? "I don't want to get hurt." With no magic, agility, or strength to speak of, 
                        this walking fortress will have to get creative to beat the baddies early on. But little does she know that her pure-stat build will propel her to chaotic 
                        new heights that even the game admins couldn't account for!

                        for the violence he brought to Tempest. Is this blobby big shot cunning enough to kill two birds with one stone?

It's useless for combat, but if he plays his cards right, there's gold in rare goods.

                        Japanese food isn't an everyday sight! Quiet days lead to silent storms, especially once a gluttonous fenrir starts causing trouble and asking for seconds!

                          Uno Hinako throws herself into makeup, fashion, and falling in love, hoping that will make her seem "normal" to the other people at her job. 
                          But no matter how hard she tries, she's a self-doubting mess inside, and her attempts at "normal" romance with men just keep failing. When she starts to think she might be alone forever, 
                          a new normal presents itself in the form of her relationship with Asahi Sato, a level-headed woman who works at her company. It starts as respect, and then it becomes far more intimate.

                      <p>
                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls.
                        What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.
                        However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.
                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures,
                        Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                        It just so happens that the topic of this particular meeting is how best to punish Rimuru for assuming his new title without their permission.Fortunately, he's got friends in high places who are willing to vouch for his authenticity, and this council could be the perfect opportunity to get revenge on the demon lord Clayman 
                        for the violence he brought to Tempest. Is this blobby big shot cunning enough to kill two birds with one stone?

                        And so begins Mukouda Tsuyoshi's life in another world. And if he thought his strength was bad, his special skill is... accessing his old online supermarket?! It's useless for combat, but if he plays his cards right, there's gold in rare goods. At least, that's what Mukouda thinks, but it turns out his modern food might be more special than it appears - and in this world, 
                        Japanese food isn't an everyday sight! Quiet days lead to silent storms, especially once a gluttonous fenrir starts causing trouble and asking for seconds!

                          a new normal presents itself in the form of her relationship with Asahi Sato, a level-headed woman who works at her company. It starts as respect, and then it becomes far more intimate.

                      <p>
                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls.
                        What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.
                        However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.
                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures,
                        Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                        Maple, she pumps all her points into defense from the get-go! Her reasoning? "I don't want to get hurt." With no magic, agility, or strength to speak of, 
                        this walking fortress will have to get creative to beat the baddies early on. But little does she know that her pure-stat build will propel her to chaotic 
                        new heights that even the game admins couldn't account for!

                        It just so happens that the topic of this particular meeting is how best to punish Rimuru for assuming his new title without their permission.Fortunately, he's got friends in high places who are willing to vouch for his authenticity, and this council could be the perfect opportunity to get revenge on the demon lord Clayman 
                        for the violence he brought to Tempest. Is this blobby big shot cunning enough to kill two birds with one stone?

                        It's great being a hero! Super powers, loved by every-- wait, what? Brought over by mistake? These stats are awful, and the kingdom sure seems sketchy...
                        And so begins Mukouda Tsuyoshi's life in another world. And if he thought his strength was bad, his special skill is... accessing his old online supermarket?! It's useless for combat, but if he plays his cards right, there's gold in rare goods. At least, that's what Mukouda thinks, but it turns out his modern food might be more special than it appears - and in this world, 
                        Japanese food isn't an everyday sight! Quiet days lead to silent storms, especially once a gluttonous fenrir starts causing trouble and asking for seconds!

                       The visitors include denizens of the other world, and customers seek out its excellent "Toriaezu Nama" ale and cuisine.

                      <p>
                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls.
                        What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.
                        However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.
                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures,
                        Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                        the bizarre and dangerous minions of the underworld. But the meisters' own personal quirks may prove a bigger obstacle than any sultry enchantress!

                          Uno Hinako throws herself into makeup, fashion, and falling in love, hoping that will make her seem "normal" to the other people at her job. 
                          But no matter how hard she tries, she's a self-doubting mess inside, and her attempts at "normal" romance with men just keep failing. When she starts to think she might be alone forever, 
                          a new normal presents itself in the form of her relationship with Asahi Sato, a level-headed woman who works at her company. It starts as respect, and then it becomes far more intimate.
